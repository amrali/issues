A SUB socket should have its socket EVENTS set to 
POLLIN when it has a message in queue. This works
when the SUB socket *connects* and the PUB socket
binds, but it FAILS when the SUB socket *binds* and
the PUB socket connects.

issue.c shows the failure.

issue_works.c shows how it works with the connect/bind swapped
