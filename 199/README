(some details in here are specific to the 3-0 testcase)

Keep a 'while ./stress ; do ; done' running.

then start ./server

./stress:
	uses XREQ and connects to "tcp://localhost:5555"

	sends 20 multipart message of the form:
		[
		'####stress',
		'####AAAAAAAA',
		'####BBBBBBBB',
		'####CCCCCCCC',
		'####DDDDDDDD',
		'####EEEEEEEE'
		]
	where '####' is: "%i.%i.", getpid(), i
		where i is the number of the mp-message

./server:
	uses XREP and binds to "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555"

	receives messages and checks the contents to
	be what ./stress sends

	if a violation is detected, it is explained
	and some more messages are received and printed
	for debugging purposes. after that assert(0)
	is triggered.
